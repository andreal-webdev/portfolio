            <p>
                This was a school project where we needed to develop a responsive website. We were free to choose the theme of the website. 
                I choose to develop a ballet website because I used to do ballet when I was younger, and I have great memories of it
            </p>

            <h2 class="display-7 mt-4">Technology used:</h2>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="ml-4">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col">
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li>HTML</li>
                                <li>CSS</li>
                                <li>Bootstrap</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2 class="display-7 mt-4">Ideation</h2>

            <p>
                I started by creating a mood board, selecting a colour palette, typography, and by selecting the images I was going to need. Then, I continue by exploring different ballet studio websites to know what information I should include. 
                After this I decided I wanted to add the different packages of classes, an about page that gives a short bio of the couches, levels, and a contact page. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                The images I used were taken from different royalty free sources, like Adobe stock, Pexels, and Pixabay. I created the logo using Adobe illustrator. I also sketched some possible low fidelity prototypes. 
            </p>

            
            <img src="./assets/ideation-ballet.JPG" width=" 800px" class="pb-2 img-fluid" height="auto"; alt="figma layout">
            
            

            <h2 class="display-7 mt-4">Development</h2>

            <p>
                This project is mainly built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. When I built this project, I only used media queries for the responsiveness. 
                However, I’m working in updating this site by using Bootstrap. I like using Bootstrap over media queries because the code is a lot shorter, 
                is faster to apply classes, and because I want to be more confident while using this framework.  
            </p>  
            <p> 
                I used flex boxes to display the prices of the classes, and a grid for the different levels that people can choose to go.
                For the gallery section I used a jQuery carrousel, which automatically changes the images, but also users can click on the arrows to move from one image to the other. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="display-7 mt-4">Reflection</h2>

            <p>
                This was a project I created in my second semester, so I’m happy of what I accomplished because I was just starting to understand the different concepts, 
                and I was very excited to learn more. My new goal for this project is to change completely use Bootstrap, and to give it a modern look. 
                I want the contact section can send a message. Lastly, I still have the same desire of learning more and be really good at coding and designing websites. 
                But I know I have to be patient and master the fundamentals first. The rest will come eventually.
